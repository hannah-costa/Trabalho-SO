# Trabalho-SO

Professor: Francisco Jose da Silva e Silva<br>

Compilation: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       gcc -o shell simple-shell.c <br>

Commands: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    pwd, cd, ls, more, grep, exit <br>

Known bugs: <br> 
* Allows one pipe only; <br>
* when piping occurs, it usually happens in the opposite order.
